Overview of files:
simple_add.c - Contains the C code for the system call.
Makefile - Contains build process information. Modifications to this file are what allowed the system call code to be included in the kernel.
syscall_64.tbl - Registers the system calls within the kernel. The system call numbers I used were 326 for helloworld and 327 for simple_add.
syscalls.h - Contains prototypes for system calls.
syslog - System log file. Recent entries include the output of printk statements within the system calls which I added.
test.c - Source code for my test program. This first calls helloworld and then simple_add using the hard-coded entries 3 and 4.

Instructions for Building and Running Test Program:
gcc test.c -o test
./test
